The final project was based on creating a simulation on where the intelligent agent would travel around a maze in search of treasure. Depending on the result, the agent would be rewarded or be “punished.” This would then have the agent look at what it did and alter its path so it could find the treasure faster. The AI would learn by itself to get the best results 100% of the time. Many repetitions of the experiment were done until the unit could pass the test every single time. Most of the code was already set up, the part on how the agent needed to learn was the part that needed to be done. 


As computer scientists, their job is not just to create code but also analyze it and apply reverse engineering to learn from older legacy code. Everything in the world now has some type of machine part to it, from the phones we all use to even something as simple as a 10-dollar toaster. There is still a small computer in the toaster that a coder needed to program. With the world changing every day, life is getting more dependent on technology. By reverse engineering different products, a computer scientist can see what issues are and help patch them for growth in the product. When an issue comes into light, the problem should be broken down into smaller parts to make it more manageable.


Ethical issues to the user and organization are that a product should be released as complete as possible. Depending on the product, having vulnerabilities could be dangerous to the company. Something like a video game could be released a little more relaxed, but if the product was something that stored user information, security is top priority. There should be plenty of time to test the product before release so no issues will return later. As a computer scientist, you can’t be perfect every time. But when a issue comes up, it’s their job to make sure they can do what they can to patch any issues.
